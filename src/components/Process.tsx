I come up with moodboards based on the project's industry and send out a questionnaire to get feedback from clients on questions like top 3 products they think are well designed, adjectives to qualify the way they want people to feel using the product. I also show them couple of products doing something similar already and also industry trends that we could borrow from to bring value to the users.</p>

                <p className="text-base text-[#808080]">This is the phase where I open Figma on my PC and start creating pages titled; cover page, style guide, HiFi designs etc. I start with a couple of design screens to present to the client before stepping on the acceleration pedal - when the client is pleased. There are some projects I don't jump straight to the High Fidelity Designs but with a Low Fidelity Wireframe to ensure we're on the same page. This phase is not a liner process as I present my designs to the clients on an agreed time, getting feedback and talking about certain design elements have been used.</p>

Where any feature set isn't clear, I jump on a call with the engineering team and also track UI fixes using clickup.</p>

This is a continuous process but if the product meets a set quality index benchmark, it's pushed to production and feedback from actual users are noted and attended to as well..</p>
